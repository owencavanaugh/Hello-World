- ## Project Title

  **Variables Affecting Student Math Performance**

- ## Description 

  I worked with a group of students in my Business Analytics class to determine what indepedent variables affected our dependent variable the most. We used data from kaggle to find our dataset for this project. 
    
    1. Math Score (*Dependent*)
    2. Reading Score (*Indepedent*) 
    3. Writing Score (*Indepedent*)
    4. Gender (*Indepedent*)
    5. Race/Ethnicity (*Indepedent*)
    6. Parental Level of Education (*Indepedent*)
    7. Lunch Type (*Indepedent*)
    8. Preparation Course (*Indepedent*)
 
  We used a variety of tools in excel and concluded that male, race/ethnicity (A,B,C,D), parents with associates degree, and standard lunch were the best predictors of math score. 

- ## Tools Used 
  Excel was used for the entirety of the project

   We preformed:
  - Descriptive Analysis (Categoric, Numberic)
  - Hypothesis Testing
  - Correlation
  - Dummy Variables
  - Regression
  - Residuals
  - VIF
   
- ## Files Used
